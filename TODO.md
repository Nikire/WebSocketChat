# TODO List

Mark an x when it's done

- [ ] Task 1: Add emojis and reactions to messages - new model (reactions) and asssociations
- [ ] Task 2: Add user profile - user routes and controllers (you can also expand the user model)
- [ ] Task 3: Add user status (online/offline) - socket (we need a way to know if the user is offline)
- [ ] Task 4: Add moderation tools (Delete messages or ban users from chat channels) - admin user
- [ ] Task 5: Add multiple chat channels, like slack or discord channels - new model (rooms model) 
- [ ] Task 6: Add the possibility to create a private channel that has password - maybe you can solve this on task 5 (add routes and controllers)
- [ ] Task 7: Add pagination system on chat history, we just want a couple of messages,not every message because this will cause a lot of problems
